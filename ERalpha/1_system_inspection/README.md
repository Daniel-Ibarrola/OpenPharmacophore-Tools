# System Inspection

PDBID: 1QKU

## Tasks

- Download the pdb
- View the pdb whole system with nglview
- Identify the different molecules
- Choose the receptor-ligand we are goint to work with
	- This pdb has multiple receptor-ligand systems. Are all receptors similar? Do they have
	  the same sequence? Are they structurally similar? Run a structural alignment or fit by
          hand the backbone of the common residues to get the rmsd between them.

### Useful tools

- Python, Jupyter, etc.
- NGLView
- MDTraj
