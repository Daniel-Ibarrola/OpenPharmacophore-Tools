# Ligand preparation

PDBID: 1QKU

## Tasks

- Extract a ligand from the 1QKU pdb and write a new pdb file with it.
- Prepare the ligand for its simulation in a water box.
- Add hydrogens to the ligand.
- Build two ligand systems. The first one parameterized with the last version of the classic amber forcefield for
  ligands: GAFF. The second one with recent version 1.0 of the OpenForcefield Parsley.
- Solvate both systems with tip3p waters (truncated octahedral box with a 14 angstroms clearance).

### Useful tools

- Python, Jupyter, etc.
- OpenMM
- OpenForcefield
- RDKit
