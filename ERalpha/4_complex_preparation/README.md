# Complex preparation

PDBID: 1QKU

## Tasks

- Extract a receptor-ligand system from the 1QKU pdb and write a new pdb file with it.
- Combine what you learned in "2_receptor_preparation" and "3_ligand_preparation" to prepare a
  system receptor-ligand solvated, with ions if necessary, using the forcefields AMBER14 for the
protein, TIP3P for water and OpenForcefield for the ligand. The box will be truncated octahedral
with 14 angstroms of clearance.

### Useful tools

- Python, Jupyter, etc.
- PDBFixer
- OpenMM
- OpenForcefield
- RDKit

### Useful sources

Those useful sources in "2_receptor_preparation" and "3_ligand_preparation".
